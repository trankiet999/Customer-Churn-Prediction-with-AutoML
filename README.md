# Customer Churn Prediction using AutoML

This project aims to leverage AutoML tools, specifically PyCaret, to build a predictive model for customer churn. The dataset used is the Telco customer churn dataset from Kaggle. The model will help identify customers who are likely to cancel their subscriptions, enabling proactive retention strategies. 

## Key Steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilize Pandas Profiling for in-depth data understanding and identify preprocessing needs.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data, addressing missing values and encoding categorical variables. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Building & Tuning:** Employ PyCaret to automate the machine learning pipeline, comparing various models and selecting the best one based on F1-score. Fine-tune the chosen model for optimal performance.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Visualize model performance using confusion matrix, learning curve, and feature importance plots. Provide insights and analysis.
5. **Performance Assessment:** Calculate and interpret key performance metrics on the test set to gauge the model's real-world effectiveness.

# Customer Churn Analysis

To further enhance the understanding of the dataset and identify preprocessing needs, an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted. The detailed analysis report can be accessed using the link below:
